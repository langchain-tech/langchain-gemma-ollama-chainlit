# langchain-gemma-ollama-chainlit
Simple Chat UI using Gemma model via Ollama, LangChain and Chainlit

### Open Source in Action üöÄ
- [Gemma](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/model_card) as Large Language model via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) as a Framework for LLM
- [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) for developing, collaborating, testing, deploying, and monitoring LLM applications.
- [Chainlit](https://docs.chainlit.io/langchain) for deploying.

## System Requirements

You must have Python 3.10 or later installed. Earlier versions of python may not compile.

## Steps to Replicate 

1. Fork this repository and create a codespace in GitHub as I showed you in the youtube video OR Clone it locally.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/langschain/langchain-gemma-ollama-chainlit.git
   cd langchain-gemma-ollama-chainlit
   ```

2. Create a virtualenv and activate it
   ```
   python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. OPTIONAL - Rename example.env to .env with `cp example.env .env`and input the environment variables from [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/). You need to create an account in LangSmith website if you haven't already.
   ``` 
   LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
   LANGCHAIN_ENDPOINT="https://api.smith.langchain.com"
   LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   LANGCHAIN_PROJECT="your-project"
   ```

4. Run the following command in the terminal to install necessary python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the following command in your terminal to start the chat UI:
   ```
   chainlit run langchain_gemma_ollama.py
   ```
